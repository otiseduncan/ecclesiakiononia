<h1 align="CENTER">THE ODES OF SOLOMON.</h1>
<p>HERE are some of the most beautiful songs of peace and joy that the world possesses. Yet their origin, the date of their writing, and the exact meaning of many of the verses remain one of the great literary mysteries.</p>
<p>They have come down to us in a single and very ancient document in Syriac language. Evidently that document is a translation from the original Greek. Critical debate has raged around these Odes; one of the most plausible explanations is that they are songs of newly baptized Christians of the First Century.</p>
<p>They are strangely lacking in historical allusions. Their radiance is no reflection of other days. They do not borrow from either the Old Testament or the Gospels. The inspiration of these verses is first-hand. They remind you of Aristides' remark, "<i>A new people with whom something Divine is mingled</i>." Here is vigor and insight to which we can find parallels only in the most exalted parts of the Scriptures.</p>
<p>For these dazzling mystery odes, we owe our translation to J. Rendel Harris, MA., Hon. Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge. He says about them: "There does not seem to be anything about which everyone seem agreed unless it be that the Odes are of singular beauty and high spiritual value."</p>

<p>1 No man, O my God, changeth thy holy place;<br/> 2 And it is not (possible) that he should change it and put it in another place: because he hath no power over it:<br/> 3 For thy sanctuary thou hast designed before thou didst make (other) places:<br/> 4 That which is the older shall not be altered by those that are younger than itself.<br/> 5 Thou has given thy heart, O Lord, to thy believers: never wilt thou fail, nor be without fruits:<br/> 6 For one hour of thy Faith is more precious than all days and years.<br/> 7 For who is there that shall put on thy grace, and be hurt?<br/> 8 For thy seal is known: and thy creatures know it: and thy (heavenly) hosts possess it: and the elect archangels are clad with it.<br/> 9 Thou hast given us thy fellowship: it was not that thou wast in need of us: but that we are in need of thee:<br/> 10 Distill thy dews upon us and open thy rich fountains that pour forth to us milk and honey:<br/> 11 For there is no repentance with thee that thou shouldest repent of anything that thou hast promised:<br/> 12 And the end was revealed before thee: for what thou gavest, thou gavest freely:<br/> 13 So that thou mayest, not draw them back and take them again:<br/> 14 For all was revealed before thee as God, and ordered from the beginning before thee: and thou, O God, hast made all things.

<p>1 As the wings of doves over their nestlings; and the mouth of their nestlings towards their mouths.<br/> 2 So also are the wings of the Spirit over my heart:<br/> 3 My heart is delighted and exults: like the babe who exults in the womb of his mother:<br/> 4 I believed; therefore I was at rest; for faithful is He in whom I have believed:<br/> 5 He has richly blessed me and my head is with Him: and the sword shall not divide me from Him, nor the scimitar;<br/> 6 For I am ready before destruction comes; and I have been set on His immortal pinions:<br/> 7 And He showed me His sign: forth and given me to drink, and from that life is the spirit within me, and it cannot die, for it lives.<br/> 8 They who saw me marvelled at me, because I was persecuted, and they supposed that I was swallowed up: for I seemed to them as one of the lost;<br/> 9 And my oppression became my salvation; and I was their reprobation because there was no zeal in me;<br/> 10 Because I did good to every man I was hated,<br/> 11 And they came round me like mad dogs, who ignorantly attack their masters,<br/> 12 For their thought is corrupt and their understanding perverted.<br/> 13 But I was carrying water in my right hand, and their bitterness I endured by my sweetness;<br/> 14 And I did not perish, for I was not their brother nor was my birth like theirs.<br/> 15 And they sought for my death and did not find it: for I was older than the memorial of them;<br/> 16 And vainly did they make attack upon me and those who, without reward, came after me:<br/> 17 They sought to destroy the memorial of him who was before them.<br/> 18 For the thought of the Most High cannot be anticipated; and His heart is superior to all wisdom. Hallelujah.</p>

<p><i>A song that Marcus Aurelius might have known when he said</i> "<i>Be like the promontory against which the waves continually break</i>."</p>
<p>1 The abysses were dissolved before the Lord: and darkness was destroyed by His appearance:<br/> 2 Error went astray and perished at His hand: and folly found no path to walk in, and was submerged by the truth of the Lord.<br/> 3 He opened His mouth and spake grace and joy: and He spake a new song of praise to His name:<br/> 4 And He lifted up His voice to the Most High, and offered to Him the sons that were with Him.<br/> 5 And His face was justified, for thus His holy Father had given to Him.<br/> 6 Come forth, ye that have been afflicted and receive joy, and possess your souls by His grace; and take to you immortal life.<br/> 7 And they made me a debtor when I rose up, me who had been a debtor: and they divided my spoil, though nothing was due to them.<br/> 8 But I endured and held my peace and was silent, as if not, moved by them.<br/> 9 But I stood unshaken like a firm rock which is beaten by the waves and endures.<br/> 10 And I bore their bitterness for humility's sake:<br/> 11 In order, that I might redeem my people, and inherit it and that I might not make void my promises to the fathers, to whom I promised the salvation of their seed.

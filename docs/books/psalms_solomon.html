<h1 align="CENTER">THE PSALMS OF SOLOMON</h1>
<p>THIS collection of eighteen war songs are the gift of an ancient Semitic writer. The original manuscript has perished but fortunately Greek translations have been preserved, and recently a Syriac version of the same songs has turned up and was published in English for the first time in 1909 by Dr. Rendel Harris.</p>
<p>The date of the writing may be established at the middle of the First Century B. C. because the theme of these songs is that of Pompey's actions in Palestine and his death in Egypt in 48 B. C.</p>
<p>These psalms had an important position and were widely circulated in the early Church. They are frequently referred to in the various Codexes and histories of the first few centuries of the Christian Era.</p>
<p>Later, they became lost through inexplicable reasons; and have only been recovered for our use after the lapse of many centuries.</p>
<p>Besides the literary value of the trumpet-like <a href="errata.htm#4">rhythm</a> of these verses, we have here a chapter of stirring ancient history written by an eyewitness. Pompey comes out of the West. He uses battering-rams on the fortifications. His soldiers defile the altar. He is slain in Egypt after a fearful career. In the "righteous" of these psalms we see the Pharisees; in the "sinners" we see the Sadducees. It is an epic of a great people in the throes of a great crisis.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER">II.</h3>
<p><i>The desecration of Jerusalem; captivity, murder, and raping. A psalm of utter despair</i>.</p>
<p>When the sinner waxed proud, with a battering-ram he cast down fortified walls, <a name="page_106"><font color="green" size="1">p. 106</font></a><br/>   And thou didst not restrain him.<br/> Alien nations ascended Thine altar,<br/>   They trampled it proudly with their sandals;<br/> Because the sons of Jerusalem had defiled the holy things of the Lord,<br/>   Had profaned with iniquities the offerings of God.<br/> Therefore He said: Cast them far from Me;<br/>     .       .       .       .       .       .<br/> It was set at naught before God,<br/>   It was utterly dishonoured;<br/> The sons and the daughters were m grievous captivity,<br/>   Sealed was their neck, branded was it among the nations.</p>
<p>According to their sins hath He done unto them,<br/>   For He hath left them in the hands of them that prevailed.<br/> He hath turned away His face from pitying them,<br/>   Young and old and their children together;<br/> For they had done evil one and all, in not hearkening.<br/>   And the heavens were angry,<br/> And the earth abhorred them;<br/>   For no man upon it had done what they did,<br/> And the earth recognized all<br/>   Thy righteous judgements, O God.<br/> They set the sons of Jerusalem to be mocked at in return for the harlots in her;<br/>   Every wayfarer entered in in the full light of day.<br/> They made mock with their transgressions, as they themselves were wont to do;<br/>   In the full light of day they revealed their iniquities.<br/> And the daughters of Jerusalem were defiled in accordance with Thy judgement,<br/>   Because they had defiled themselves with unnatural intercourse.<br/> I am pained in my bowels and my inward parts for these things.</p>
<p>And yet I will justify Thee, O God, in uprightness of heart,<br/>   For in Thy judgements is Thy righteousness displayed, O God.<br/> For Thou hast rendered to the sinners according to their deeds,<br/>   Yea, according to their sins, which were very wicked.<br/> Thou hast uncovered their sins, that Thy judgement might be manifest;<br/>   Thou hast wiped out their memorial from the earth.<br/> God is a righteous judge,<br/>   And he is no respecter of persons.</p>
<p>For the nations reproached Jerusalem, trampling it down;<br/>   Her beauty was dragged down from the throne of glory.<br/> She girded on sackcloth instead of comely raiment,<br/>   A rope was about her head instead of a crown.<br/> She put off the glorious diadem which God had set upon her,<br/>   In dishonour was her beauty cast upon the ground.</p>
<p>And I saw and entreated the Lord and said,<br/>   Long enough, O Lord has Thine hand been heavy on Israel, in bringing the nations upon them.<br/> For they have made sport unsparingly in wrath and fierce anger;<br/>   And they will make an utter end, unless Thou, O Lord, rebuke them in Thy wrath.<br/> For they have done. it not in zeal, but in lust of soul,<br/>   Pouring out their wrath upon us with a view to rapine.<br/> Delay not, O God, to recompense them on their heads,<br/>   To turn the pride of the dragon into dishonour. <a name="page_107"><font color="green" size="1">p. 107</font></a><br/> And I had not long to wait before God showed me the insolent one<br/>   Slain on the mountains of Egypt,<br/>   Esteemed of less account than the least, on land and sea;<br/> His body, too, borne hither and thither on the billows with much insolence,<br/>   With none to bury him, because He had rejected him with dishonour.</p>
<p>He reflected not that he was man,<br/>   And reflected not on the latter end;<br/> He said: I will be lord of land and sea;<br/>   And he recognized not that it is God who is great,<br/>   Mighty in His great strength.<br/> He is king over the heavens,<br/>   And judgeth kings and kingdoms.<br/> It is He who setteth me up in glory,<br/>   And bringeth down the proud to eternal destruction in dishonour,<br/>   Because they knew Him not.</p>
<p>And now behold, ye princes of the earth, the judgement of the Lord,<br/>   For a great king and righteous is He, judging all that is under heaven.<br/> Bless God, ye that fear the Lord with wisdom,<br/>   For the mercy of the Lord will ~e upon them that fear Him, m the Judgement;<br/> So that He will distinguish between the righteous and the sinner,<br/>   And recompense the sinners for ever according to their deeds;<br/> And have mercy on the righteous, delivering him from the affliction of the sinner,<br/>   And recompensing the sinner for what he bath done to the righteous.<br/> For the Lord is good to them that call upon Him in patience,<br/>   Doing according to His mercy to His pious ones,<br/>   Establishing them at all times before Him in strength.</p>
<p>Blessed be the Lord for ever before His servants.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><i>Righteousness versus Sin</i>.</p>
<p>Why sleepest thou, O my soul,<br/>   And blessest not the Lord?<br/> Sing a new song,<br/>   Unto God who is worthy to be praised.<br/> Sing and be wakeful against His awaking,<br/>   For good is a psalm sung to God from a glad heart.</p>
<p>The righteous remember the Lord at all times,<br/>   With thanksgiving and declaration of the righteousness of the Lord's judgements.<br/> The righteous despiseth not the chastening of the Lord;<br/>   His will is always before the Lord.<br/> The righteous stumbleth and holdeth the Lord righteous:<br/>   He falleth and looketh out for what God will do to him;<br/> He seeketh out whence his deliverance will come.<br/>   The steadfastness of the righteous is from God, their deliverer;<br/> There lodgeth not in the house of the righteous sin upon sin.<br/>   The righteous continually searcheth his house,<br/> To remove utterly all iniquity done by him in error.<br/>   He maketh atonement for sins of ignorance by fasting and afflicting his soul,<br/> And the Lord counteth guiltless every pious man and his house. <a name="page_108"><font color="green" size="1">p. 108</font></a><br/>   The sinner stumbleth and curseth his life<br/> The day when he was begotten, and his mother's travail.<br/>   He addeth sins to sins, while he liveth;<br/> He falleth--verily grievous is his fall--and riseth no more.<br/>   The destruction of the sinner is for ever,<br/> And he shall not be remembered, when the righteous is visited.<br/>   This is the portion of sinners for ever.</p>
<p>But they that fear the Lord shall rise to life eternal,<br/>   And their life shall be in the light of the Lord, and shall come to an end no more.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><i>A conversation of Solomon with the Men-pleasers</i>.</p>
<p>Wherefore sittest thou, O profane man, in the council of the pious,<br/>   Seeing that thy heart is far removed from the Lord,<br/>   Provoking with transgressions the God of Israel?<br/> Extravagant in speech, extravagant in outward seeming beyond all men,<br/>   Is he that is severe of speech in condemning sinners in judgement.<br/> And his hand is first upon him as though he acted in zeal,<br/>   And yet he is himself guilty in respect of manifold sins and of wantonness.<br/> His eyes are upon every woman without distinction;<br/>   His tongue lieth when he maketh contract with an oath.<br/> By night and in secret he sinneth as though unseen,<br/>   With his eyes he talketh to every woman of evil compacts.<br/> He is swift to enter every house with cheerfulness as though guileless.</p>
<p>Let God remove those that live in hypocrisy in the company of the pious,<br/>   Even the life of such an one with corruption of his flesh and penury.<br/> Let God reveal the deeds of the men-pleasers,<br/>   The deeds of such an one with laughter and derision;<br/> That the pious may count righteous the judgement of their God,<br/>   When sinners are removed from before the righteous,<br/>   Even the man-pleaser who uttereth law guilefully.<br/> And their eyes are fixed upon any man's house that is still secure,<br/>   That they may, like the Serpent, destroy the wisdom of . . . with words of transgressors,<br/> His words are deceitful that he may accomplish his wicked desire.<br/>   He never ceaseth from scattering families as though they were orphans,<br/>   Yea, he layeth waste a house on account of his lawless desire.<br/> He deceiveth with words, saying, There is none that seeth, or judgeth.<br/> He fills one house with lawlessness,<br/>   And then his eyes are fixed upon the next house,<br/>   To destroy it with words that give wing to desire.<br/> Yet with all these his soul like Sheol, is not sated.</p>
<p>Let his portion, O Lord, be dishonoured before thee;<br/>   Let him go forth groaning, and come home cursed.<br/> Let his life be spent in anguish, and penury, and want, O Lord; <a name="page_109"><font color="green" size="1">p. 109</font></a><br/>   Let his sleep be beset with pains and his awaking with perplexities.<br/> Let sleep be withdrawn from his eyelids at night;<br/>   Let him fail dishonourably in every work of his hands.<br/> Let him come home empty-handed to his house,<br/>   And his house be void of everything wherewith he could sate his appetite.<br/> Let his old age be spent in childless loneliness until his removal by death.</p>
<p>Let the flesh of the men-pleasers be rent by wild beasts,<br/>   And let the bones of the lawless lie dishonoured in the sight of the sun.<br/> Let ravens peck out the eyes of the hypocrites.<br/> For they have laid waste many houses of men, in dishonour,<br/>   And scattered them in their lust;<br/> And they have not remembered God,<br/>   Nor feared God in all these things;<br/>   But they have provoked God's anger and vexed Him.<br/> May He remove them from off the earth,<br/>   Because with deceit they beguiled the souls of the flawless.</p>
<p>Blessed are they that fear the Lord in their flawlessness;<br/>   The Lord shall deliver them from guileful men and sinners,<br/>   And deliver us from every stumbling-block of the lawless (men).<br/> Let God destroy them that insolently work all unrighteousness,<br/>   For a great and mighty judge is the Lord our God in righteousness.</p>
<p>Let Thy mercy, O Lord, be upon all them that love Thee.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><i>A statement of the philosophy of the indestructibility of matter. One of the tenets of modern physics</i>.</p>
<p>O Lord God, I will praise Thy name with joy,<br/>   In the midst of them that know Thy righteous judgements.<br/> For Thou art good and merciful, the refuge of the poor;<br/>   When I cry to Thee, do not silently disregard me.<br/> For no man taketh spoil from a mighty man;<br/>   Who, then, can take aught of a that Thou hast made, except Thou Thyself givest?<br/> For man and his portion lie before Thee in the balance;<br/>   He cannot add to, so as to enlarge, what has been prescribed by Thee.</p>
<p>O God, when we are in distress we call upon Thee for help,<br/>   And Thou dost not turn back our petition, for Thou art our God.<br/> Cause not Thy hand to be heavy upon us,<br/>   Lest through necessity we sin.<br/> Even though Thou restore us not, we will not keep away;<br/>   But unto Thee will we come.<br/> For if I hunger, unto Thee will I cry, O God;<br/>   And <i>Thou</i> wilt give to me.</p>
<p>Birds and fish dost Thou nourish,<br/>   In that Thou givest rain to the steppes that green grass may spring up,<br/>   So to prepare fodder in the steppe for every living thing;<br/> And if they hunger, unto Thee do they lift up their face.<br/> Kings and rulers and peoples <i>Thou</i> dost nourish, O God;<br/>   And who is the help of the poor and needy, if not Thou, O Lord? <a name="page_110"><font color="green" size="1">p. 110</font></a><br/> And Thou wilt hearken--for who is good and gentle but thou?--<br/>   Making glad the soul of the humble by opening Thine hand in mercy.</p>
<p>Man's goodness is bestowed grudgingly and ...;<br/>   And if he repeat it without murmuring, even that is marvellous.<br/> But Thy gift is great in goodness and wealth,<br/>   And he whose hope is set on Thee shall have no lack of gifts.<br/> Upon the whole earth is Thy mercy, O Lord, in goodness.</p>
<p>Happy is he whom God remembereth in granting to him a due sufficiency;<br/>   If a man abound overmuch, he sinneth.<br/> Sufficient are moderate means with righteousness,<br/>   And hereby the blessing of the Lord becomes abundance with righteousness.<br/> They that fear the Lord rejoice in good gifts,<br/>   And thy goodness is upon Israel in Thy kingdom.</p>
<p>Blessed is the glory of the Lord, for He is our king.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><i>Some remarkable similes of war creeping on Jerusalem. A survey of the sins that brought all this trouble</i>.</p>
<p>Distress and the sound of war hath my ear heard,<br/>   The sound of a trumpet announcing slaughter and calamity,<br/> The sound of much people as of an exceeding high wind,<br/>   As a tempest with mighty fire sweeping through the Negeb.<br/> And I said in my heart, Surely God judgeth us;<br/>   A sound I hear moving towards Jerusalem, the holy city<br/> My loins were broken at what I heard, my knees tottered;<br/>   My heart was afraid, my bones were dismayed like flax.<br/> I said: They establish their ways in righteousness.</p>
<p>I thought upon the judgments of God since the creation of heaven and earth;<br/>   I held God righteous in His judgements which have been from of old.<br/> God bare their sins in the full light of day;<br/>   All the earth came to know the righteous judgements of God.<br/> In secret places underground their iniquities were committed to provoke Him to anger;<br/> They wrought confusion, son with mother and father with daughter;<br/>   They committed adultery, every man with his neighhour's wife.<br/> They concluded covenants with one another with an oath touching these things;<br/>   They plundered the sanctuary of God, as though there was no avenger.<br/> They trode the altar of the Lord, coming straight from all manner of uncleanness;<br/>   And with menstrual blood they defiled the sacrifices, as though these were common flesh.<br/> They left no sin undone, wherein they surpassed not the heathen.</p>
<p>Therefore God mingled for them a spirit of wandering;<br/>   And gave them to drink a cup of undiluted wine, that they might become drunken.<br/> He brought him that is from the end of the earth, that smiteth mightily;<br/>   He decreed war against Jerusalem, and against her land.<br/> The princes of the land went to meet him with joy: they said unto him:<br/>   Blessed be thy way! Come ye, enter ye in with peace.<br/> They made the rough ways even, before his entering in;<br/>   They opened the gates to Jerusalem, they crowned its walls.</p>
<p>As a father entereth the house of his sons, so he entered Jerusalem in peace;<br/>   He established his feet there in great safety.<br/> He captured her fortresses and the wall of Jerusalem;<br/>   For God Himself led him in safety, while they wandered.<br/> He destroyed their princes and every one wise in counsel;<br/>   He poured out the blood of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, like the water of uncleanness. <a name="page_112"><font color="green" size="1">p. 112</font></a><br/> He led away their sons and daughters, whom they had begotten in defilement.</p>
<p>They did according to their uncleanness, even as their fathers had done:<br/>   They defiled Jerusalem and the things that had been hallowed to the name of God.<br/> But God hath shown Himself righteous in His judgements upon the nations of the earth;<br/>   And the pious servants of God are like innocent lambs in their midst.<br/> Worthy to be praised is the Lord that judgeth the whole earth in His righteousness.</p>
<p>Behold, now, O God, Thou hast shown us Thy judgement in Thy righteousness;<br/>   Our eyes have seen Thy judgements, O God.<br/> We have justified Thy name that is honoured for ever;<br/>   For Thou are the God of righteousness, judging Israel with chastening.</p>
<p>Turn, O God, Thy mercy upon us, and have pity upon us;<br/>   Gather together the dispersed of Israel, with mercy and goodness;<br/> For Thy faithfulness is with us,<br/> And though we have stiffened our neck, yet Thou art our chastener;<br/>   Overlook us not, O our God, lest the nations swallow us up, as though there were none to deliver.</p>
<p>But Thou art our God from the beginning,<br/>   And upon Thee is our hope set, O Lord;<br/> And we will not depart from Thee,<br/>   For good are Thy judgements upon us.<br/> Ours and our children's be Thy good pleasure for ever;<br/>   O Lord, our Saviour, we shall never more be moved.<br/> The Lord is worthy to be praised for His judgements with the mouth of His pious ones;<br/>   And blessed be Israel of the Lord for ever.</p>

<p>Lord, Thy mercy is over the works of Thy hands for ever;<br/>   Thy goodness is over Israel with a rich gift.<br/> Thine eyes look upon them, so that none of them suffers want;<br/>   Thine ears listen to the hopeful prayer of the poor.<br/> Thy judgements are executed upon the whole earth in mercy;<br/>   And Thy love is toward the seed of Abraham, the children of Israel.<br/> Thy chastisement is upon us as upon a first-born, only-begotten son,<br/>   To turn back the obedient soul from folly that is wrought in ignorance.<br/> May God cleanse Israel against the day of mercy and blessing,<br/>   Against the day of choice when<br/> Blessed shall they be that shall be in those days,<br/>   He bringeth back His anointed. <a name="page_120"><font color="green" size="1">p. 120</font></a><br/> In that they shall see the goodness of the Lord which He shall perform for the generation that is to come,<br/> Under the rod of chastening of the Lord's anointed in the fear of his God,<br/>   In the spirit of wisdom and righteousness and strength;<br/> That he may direct every man in the works of righteousness by the fear of God,<br/>   That he may establish them all before the Lord,<br/>   A good generation living in the fear of God in the days of mercy. Selah.</p>
<p>Great is our God and glorious, dwelling in the highest.<br/> It is He who hath established in their courses the lights of heaven for determining seasons from year to year,<br/>   And they have not turned aside from the way which He appointed them.<br/> In the fear of God they pursue their path every day,<br/>   From the day God created them and for evermore.<br/> And they have erred not since the day He created them.<br/>   Since the generations of old they have not withdrawn from their path,<br/>   Unless God commanded them so to do by the command of His servants.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER">THE BOOK OF THE SECRETS OF ENOCH.</h3>
<p>THIS new fragment of early literature came to light through certain manuscripts which were recently found in Russia and Servia and so far as is yet known has been preserved only in Slavonic. Little is known of its origin except that in its present form it was written somewhere about the beginning of the Christian era. Its final editor was a Greek and the place of its composition Egypt. Its value lies in the unquestioned influence which it has exerted on the writers of the New Testament. Some of the dark passages of the latter being all but inexplicable without its aid.</p>
<p>Although the very knowledge that such a book ever existed was lost for probably 1200 years, it nevertheless was much used by both Christian and heretic in the early centuries and forms a most valuable document in any study of the forms of early Christianity.</p>
<p>The writing appeals to the reader who thrills to lend wings to his thoughts and fly to mystical realms. Here is a strange dramatization of eternity--with views on Creation, Anthropology, and Ethics. As the world was made in six days, so its history would be accomplished in 6,000 years (or 6,000,000 years), and this would be followed by 1,000 years of rest (possibly when the balance of conflicting moral forces has been struck and human life has reached the ideal state). At its close would begin the 8th Eternal Day, when time should be no more.</p>

<p>An account of the mechanism of the world showing the machinery of the sun and moon in operation. Astronomy and an interesting ancient calendar. See Chapter 15-17 also 21. What the world was like before Creation, see Chapter 24. Chapter 26 is especially picturesque. A unique account of how Satan was created (Chapter 29.)</p>
<p>THERE was a wise man, a great artificer, and the Lord conceived love for him and received him, that he should behold the uppermost dwellings and be an eye-witness of the wise and great and inconceivable and immutable realm of God Almighty, of</p>
<p><a name="page_82"><font color="green" size="1">p. 82</font></a></p>
<p>the very wonderful and glorious and bright and many-eyed station of the Lord's servants, and of the inaccessible throne of the Lord, and of the degrees and manifestations of the incorporeal hosts, and of the ineffable ministration of the multitude of the elements, and of the various apparition and inexpressible singing of the host of Cherubim, and of the boundless light.</p>
<p>2 At that time, he said, when my 165th year was completed, I begat my son Mathusal.</p>
<p>3 After this too I lived two hundred years and completed of all the years of my life three hundred and sixty-five years.</p>
<p>4 On the first day of the first month I was in my house alone and was resting on my couch and slept.</p>
<p>5 And when I was asleep, great distress came up into my heart, and I was weeping with my eyes in sleep, and I could not understand what this distress was, or what would happen to me.</p>
<p>6 And there appeared to me two men, exceeding big, so that I never saw such on earth; their faces were shining like the sun, their eyes too <i>were</i> like a burning light, and from their lips was fire coming forth with clothing and singing of various kinds in appearance purple, their wings <i>were</i> brighter than gold, their hands whiter than snow.</p>
<p>7 They were standing at the head of my couch and began to call me by my name.</p>
<p>8 And I arose from my sleep and saw clearly those two men standing in front of me.</p>
<p>9 And I saluted them and was seized with fear and the appearance of my face was changed from terror, and those men said to me:</p>
<p>10 'Have courage, Enoch, do mot fear; the eternal God sent us to thee, and lo! thou shalt to-day ascend with us into heaven, and thou shalt tell thy sons and all thy household all that they shall do without thee on earth in thy house, and let no one seek thee till the Lord return thee to them.</p>
<p>11 And I made haste to obey them and went out from my house, and made to the doors, as it was ordered me, and summoned my sons Mathusal and Regim and Gaidad and made known to them all the marvels those <i>men</i> had told me.</p>

<p><i>Of Enoch's assumption; how the angels took him into the first heaven</i>.</p>
<p>IT came to pass, when Enoch had told his sons, that the angels took him on to their wings and bore him up on to the first heaven and placed him on the clouds.

<p>2 And I said to the men who were with me: 'Wherefore are these incessantly tortured?' they answered me: 'These are God's apostates, who obeyed not God's commands, but took counsel with their own will, and turned away with their prince, who also is fastened on the fifth heaven.'</p>
<p>3 And I felt great pity for them, and they saluted me, and said to me: 'Man of God, pray for us to the Lord'; and I answered to them: 'Who am I, a mortal man, that I should pray for angels? who knoweth whither I go, or what will befall me? or who will pray for me?'</p>

<p><i>The week in which God showed Enoch all his wisdom and power, throughout all the seven days, how he created all the heavenly and earthly forces and all moving things even down to man</i>.</p>
<p>AND then I made firm the heavenly circle, and <i>made</i> that the lower water which is under heaven collect itself together, into one whole, and that the chaos become dry, and it became so.</p>
<p>2 Out of the waves I created rock hard and big, and from the rock I piled up the dry, and the dry I called earth, and the midst of the earth I called abyss, that is to say the bottomless, I collected the sea in one place and bound it together with a yoke.</p>
<p>3 And I said to the sea: 'Behold I give thee <i>thy</i> eternal limits, and thou shalt not break loose from thy component parts.'</p>
<p>4 Thus I made fast the firmament. This day I called me the first-created.</p>

<p><i>Then it became evening, and then again morning, and it was the second day</i>. [<i>Monday is the first day</i>.] <i>The fiery Essence</i>.</p>
<p>AND for all the heavenly troops I imaged the image and essence of fire, and my eye looked at the very hard, firm rock, and from the gleam of my eye the lightning received its wonderful nature, <i>which</i> is both fire in water and water in fire, and one does not put out the other, nor does the one dry up the other, therefore the lightning is brighter than the sun, softer than water and firmer than hard rock.</p>
<p>2 And from the rock I cut off a great fire, and from the fire I created the orders of the incorporeal ten troops of angels, and their weapons are fiery and their raiment a burning flame, and I commanded that each one should stand in his order.</p>
<p><i>Here Satanail with his angels was thrown down from the height</i>.</p>
<p>3 And one from out the order of angels, having turned away with the order that was under him, conceived an impossible thought, to place his throne higher than the clouds above the earth, that he might become equal in rank to my power.</p>
<p>4 And I threw him out from the height with his angels, and he was flying in the air continuously above the bottomless.</p>

<p><i>And then I created all the heavens, and the third day was</i>, [<i>Tuesday</i>.]</p>
<p>ON the third day I commanded the earth to make grow great and fruitful trees, and</p>
<p><a name="page_92"><font color="green" size="1">p. 92</font></a></p>
<p>hills, and seed to sow, and I planted Paradise, and enclosed it, and placed as armed <i>guardians</i> flaming angels, and thus I created renewal.</p>
<p>2 Then came evening, and came morning the fourth day.</p>
<p>3 [Wednesday]. On the fourth day I commanded that there should be great lights on the heavenly circles.</p>
<p>4 On the first uppermost circle I placed the stars, Kruno, and on the second Aphrodit, on the third Aris, on the fifth Zeus, on the sixth Ermis, on the seventh lesser the moon, and adorned it with the lesser stars.</p>
<p>5 And on the lower I placed the sun for the illumination of day, and the moon and stars for the illumination of night.</p>
<p>6 The sun that it should go according to each animal (<i>sc</i>. signs of the zodiac), twelve, and I appointed the succession of the months and their names and lives, their thunderings, and their hour-markings, how they should succeed.</p>
<p>7 Then evening came and morning came the fifth day.</p>
<p>8 [Thursday]. On the fifth day I commanded the sea, that it should bring forth fishes, and feathered birds of many varieties, and all animals creeping over the earth, going forth over the earth on four legs, and soaring in the air, male sex and female, and every soul breathing the spirit of life.</p>
<p>9 And there came evening, and there came morning the sixth day.</p>
<p>10 [Friday]. On the sixth day I commanded my wisdom to create man from seven consistencies: one, his flesh from the earth; two, his blood from the dew; three, his eyes from the sun; four, his bones from stone; five, his intelligence from the swiftness of the angels and from cloud; six, his veins and his hair from the grass of the earth; seven, his soul from my breath and from the wind.</p>
<p>11 And I gave him seven natures: to the flesh hearing, the eyes for sight, to the soul smell, the veins for touch, the blood for taste, the bones for endurance, to the intelligence sweetness (<i>sc</i>. enjoyment).</p>
<p>12 I conceived a cunning saying to say, I created man from invisible and from visible nature, of both are his death and life and image, he knows speech like some created thing, small in greatness and again great in smallness, and I placed him on earth, a second angel, honourable, great and glorious, and I appointed him as ruler to rule on earth and to have my wisdom, and there was none like him of earth of all my existing creatures.</p>
<p>13 And I appointed him a name, from the four component parts, from east, from west, from south, from north, and I appointed for him four special stars, and I called his name Adam, and showed him the two ways, the light and the darkness, and I told him:</p>
<p>14 'This is good, and that bad,' that I should learn whether he has love towards me, or hatred, that it be clear which in his race love me.</p>
<p>15 For I have seen his nature, but he has not seen his own nature, therefore <i>through</i> not seeing he will sin worse, and I said 'After sin <i>what is there</i> but death?'</p>
<p>16 And I put sleep into him and he fell asleep. And I took from him a rib, and created him a wife, that death should come to him by his wife, and I took his last word and called her name mother, that is to say, Eva.</p>

<p><i>God gives over paradise to Adam, and gives him a command to see the heavens opened, and that he should see the angels singing the song of victory</i>.</p>
<p>ADAM has life on earth, and I created a garden in Eden in the east, that he should observe the testament and keep the command.</p>
<p>2 I made the heavens open to him, that he should see the angels singing the song of victory, and the gloomless light.</p>
<p>3 And he was continuously in paradise, and the devil understood that I wanted to create another world, because Adam was lord on earth, to rule and control it.</p>
<p>4 The devil is the evil spirit of the lower places, as a fugitive he made Sotona from the heavens as his name was Satanail, thus he became different from the angels, <i>but his nature</i> did not change <i>his</i> intelligence as far as <i>his</i> understanding of righteous and sinful <i>things</i>.</p>
<p>5 And he understood his condemnation and the sin which he had sinned before, therefore he conceived thought against Adam, in such form he entered and seduced Eva, but did not touch Adam.</p>
<p>6 But I cursed ignorance, but what I had blessed previously, those I did not curse, I cursed not man, nor the earth, nor other creatures, but man's evil fruit, and his works.</p>

<p><i>God shows how he does not want from men sacrifices, nor burnt-offerings, but pure and contrite hearts</i>.</p>
<p>WHOEVER hastens to make offering before the Lord's face, the Lord for his part will hasten that offering by granting of his work.</p>
<p>2 But whoever increases his lamp before the Lord's face and make not true judgement, the Lord will <i>not</i> increase his treasure in the realm of the highest.</p>
<p>3 When the Lord demands bread, or candles, or flesh (<i>sc</i>. cattle), or any other sacrifice, then that is nothing; but God demands pure hearts, and with all that <i>only</i> tests the heart of man.</p>

<p>HEAR, my people, and take in the words of my lips.</p>
<p>2 If any one bring any gifts to an earthly ruler, and have disloyal thoughts in his heart, and the ruler know this, will he not be angry with him, and not refuse his gifts, and not give him over to judgement?</p>

<p align="CENTER"><i>Of Enoch's instruction of his sons</i>.</p>
<p>AND Enoch answered all his people saying: 'Hear, my children, before that all creatures were created, the Lord created the visible and invisible things.</p>
<p>2 And as much time as there was and went past, understand that after that he created man in the likeness of his own form, and put into him eyes to see, and ears to hear, and heart to reflect, and intellect wherewith to deliberate.</p>
<p>3 And the Lord saw all man's works, and created all his creatures, and divided time, from time he fixed the years, and from the years he appointed the months, and from the months he appointed the days, and of days he appointed seven.</p>
<p>4 And in those he appointed the hours, measured them out exactly, that man might reflect on time and count years, months, and hours, <i>their</i> alternation, beginning, and end, and that he might count his own life, from the beginning until death, and reflect on his sin and write his work bad and good; because no work is hidden before the Lord, that every man might know his works and never transgress all his commandments, and keep my handwriting from generation to generation.</p>
<p>5 When all creation visible and invisible, as the Lord created it, shall end, then every man goes to the great judgement, and then all time shall perish, and the years, and thenceforward there will be neither months nor days nor hours, they will be stuck together and will not be counted.</p>
<p>6 There will be one aeon, and all the righteous who shall escape the Lord's great judgement, shall be collected in the great aeon, for the righteous the great aeon will begin, and they will live eternally, and then too there will be amongst them neither labour, nor sickness, nor humiliation, nor anxiety, nor need, nor violence, nor night, nor darkness, but. great light.</p>
<p>7 And they shall have a great indestructible wall, and a paradise bright and incorruptible, for all corruptible things shall pass away, and there will be eternal life.</p>

<p><i>Enoch instructs his sons and all the elders of the people, how they are to walk with terror and trembling before the Lord, and serve him alone and not bow down to idols, but to God, who created heaven and earth and. every creature, and to his image</i>.</p>
<p>AND now, my children, keep your souls from all injustice, such as the Lord hates.</p>
<p>2 Walk before his face with terror and trembling and serve him alone.</p>
<p><a name="page_104"><font color="green" size="1">p. 104</font></a></p>
<p>3 Bow down to the true God, not to dumb idols, but bow down to his picture, and bring all just offerings before the Lord's face. The Lord hates what is unjust.</p>
<p>4 For the Lord sees all things; when man takes thought in his heart, then he counsels the intellects, and every thought is always before the Lord, who made firm the earth and put all creatures on it.</p>
<p>5 If you look to heaven, the Lord is there; if you take thought of the sea's deep and all the under-earth, the Lord is there.</p>
<p>6 For the Lord created all things. Bow not down to things made by man, leaving the Lord of all creation, because no work can remain hidden before the Lord's face.</p>
<p>7 Walk, my children, in longsuffering, in meekness, honesty, in provocation, in grief, in faith and in truth, in <i>reliance on</i> promises, in illness, in abuse, in wounds, in temptation, in nakedness, in privation, loving one another, till you go out from this age of ills, that you become inheritors of endless time.</p>
<p>8 Blessed are the just who shall escape the great judgement, for they shall shine forth more than the sun sevenfold, for in this world the seventh part is taken off from all, light, darkness, food, enjoyment, sorrow, paradise, torture, fire, frost, and other things; he put all down in writing, that you might read and understand.'</p>

<p><i>The Lord let out darkness on to earth and covered the people and Enoch, and he was taken up on high, and light came again in the heaven</i>.</p>
<p>WHEN Enoch had talked to the people, the Lord sent out darkness on to the earth, and there was darkness, and it covered those men standing with Enoch, and they took Enoch up on to the highest heaven, where the Lord is; and he received him and placed him before his face, and the darkness went off from the earth, and light came again.</p>
<p>2 And the people saw and understood not how Enoch had been taken, and glorified God, and found a roll in which was traced 'the invisible God'; and all went to their homes.</p>

<p>ENOCH was born on the sixth day of the month Tsivan, and lived three hundred and sixty-five years.</p>
<p>2 He was taken up to heaven on the first day of the month Tsivan and remained in heaven sixty days.</p>
<p>3 He wrote all these signs of all creation, which the Lord created, and wrote three hundred and sixty-six books, and handed them over to his sons and remained on earth thirty days, and was again taken up to heaven on the sixth day of the month Tsivan, on the very day and hour when he was born.</p>
<p>4 As every man's nature in this life is dark, so are also his conception, birth, and departure from this life.</p>
<p>5 At what hour he was conceived, at that hour he was born, and at that hour too he died.</p>
<p>6 Methosalam and his brethren, all the sons of Enoch, made haste, and erected an altar at the place called Achuzan, whence and where Enoch had been taken up to heaven.</p>
<p>7 And they took sacrificial oxen and summoned all people and sacrificed the sacrifice before the Lord's face.</p>
<p>8 All people, the elders of the people and the whole assembly</p>
<p><a name="page_105"><font color="green" size="1">p. 105</font></a></p>
<p>came to the feast and brought gifts to the sons of Enoch.</p>
<p>9 And they made a great feast, rejoicing and making merry three days, praising God, who had given them such a sign through Enoch, who had found favour with him, and that they should hand it on to their sons from generation to generation, from age to age.</p>
<p>10 Amen.</p>
